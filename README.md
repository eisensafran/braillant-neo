Combination of Braille and blackletter typography.
 
This design study explores the possibility of uniting two writing systems within a single fontâ€”specifically, merging Braille and conventional print into one typeface. Up until now, both systems have coexisted side by side (for example, on wayfinding signage in public spaces or on medication packaging). In my view, true inclusion means not creating separate solutions, but rather fostering genuine participation by devising one solution that addresses multiple needs or tasks.

However, this study does not seek to abolish the parallel use of Braille and print. Instead, its primary aim is to experiment and determine whether such an integration is both feasible and meaningful in practice.
